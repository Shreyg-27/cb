# Real-Time Automatic License Plate Recognition

This project is a real-time automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) system designed to track the in and out times of campus faculty cars. The system leverages machine learning models to recognize license plates from video streams and logs the entry and exit times in a database.

## Features

- Real-time license plate detection and recognition.
- Stores entry and exit times in a database.
- Frontend interface created with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** easyocr, pyTorch
- **Image Processing Libraries:** cv2, imutils
- **Frontend Framework:** Streamlit
